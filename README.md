# pixelcnn-pytorch
A naive PyTorch implementation of different PixelCNN models for binary image dataset. 
Based on [Pixel Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06759) by van den Oord et. al.
This by no means serve to reproduce the original results in the paper.

## PixelCNN
PixelCNNs are a type of autoregressive generative models which try to model the generation of images as a sequence of generation of pixels.
They preserve the autoregressive property (i-th output pixel only dependent on the i-1 previous pixels) while using convolutional filters.
This is done by masking the convolutional filters, see figure below.

## Datasets
The four datasets used:

Shapes | MNIST | Color Shapes | Color MNIST

## Generated samples from the models
Below are samples generated by the different PixelCNN models (for shape and mnist dataset) after training:
PixelCNN | PixelRCNN | pixel... | pixel...
