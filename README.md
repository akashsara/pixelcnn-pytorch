# pixelcnn-pytorch
A naive PyTorch implementation of different PixelCNN models. 
Based on [Pixel Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06759) by van den Oord et. al.
This by no means serve to reproduce the original results in the paper.

## PixelCNN
PixelCNNs are a type of autoregressive generative models which try to model the generation of images as a sequence of generation of pixels.
They preserve the autoregressive property (i-th output pixel only dependent on the i-1 previous pixels) while using convolutional filters.
This is done by masking the convolutional filters, see figure below.

## PixelCNN models
#### Regular PixelCNN
This model followes a simple PixelCNN architecture to model binary MNIST and shapes images. 
It has the following network design: 
- A  7×7  masked type A convolution
- 5  7×7  masked type B convolutions
- 2  1×1  masked type B convolutions
- Appropriate ReLU nonlinearities and Batch Normalization in-between
- 64 convolutional filters

#### PixelCNN with independent color channels (PixelRCNN)
This model supports RGB color channels, but models the color channels independently.
Trained on color Shapes and color MNIST.
It has the following network design:
- A 7×7  masked type A convolution
- 8 residual blocks with masked type B convolutions
- Appropriate ReLU nonlinearities and Batch Normalization in-between
- 128 convolutional filters

#### PixelCNN with dependent color channels (Autoregressive PixelRCNN)
This PixelCNN models dependent color channels. This is done by changing the masking scheme for
the center pixel. The filters are split into 3 groups, only allowing each group to see the groups before (or including the current group, for type B masks) to maintain the autoregressive property.

#### Conditional PixelCNNs
This PixelCNN is class-conditional on binary MNIST and binary Shapes.
Class labels are conditioned on by adding a conditional bias in each convolutional layer.
Similar architecture as normal PixelCNN. 

## Generated samples from the models
